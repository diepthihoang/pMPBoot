//
//  parsimonymove.h
//  Describes a possible parsimony move (in practice, one
//  found during parsimony SPR or parsimony TBR).
//
//  Created by James Barbetti on 18-Jan-2021.
//
//  Note: The reason that Parsimony NNI doesn't make use of
//  the same "framework" is that I "factored" it out of the
//  Parsimony SPR code, when I realized how much the Parsimony
//  TBR code had in common with it.   If I had worked on SPR
//  and TBR first, the parsimony NNI code would probably make
//  use of ParsimonyMove too.  I might still retrofit.

//
// likelihoodbufferset.h
// A set of buffers, used for likelihood calculations, that are external to
// the nodes in a tree, that cannot be shared between threads that are
// independently calculating likelihoods on mutually inconsistent *possible*
// subtrees.
//
// Each instance of PhyloTree has its own LikelihoodBufferSet (tree_buffers),
// (and that is what is used, most of the time).
//
// But, during likelihod placement, likelihoods for many possible candidate
// subtrees (that differ only in one leaf and one interior node), potentially
// connected to the tree at the same point, are calculated, possibly in parallel.
// Each such calculation (for a different potential subtree) needs its own
// set of buffers.
//
// See in particular, LikelihoodCostCalculator::assessPlacementCost,
// in placement/placementcostcalculator.cpp.
//
// Created by James Barbetti on 09-Oct-2020.
// (but the members of this class were all members of
//  the PhyloTree class, defined in phylotree.h, until then)

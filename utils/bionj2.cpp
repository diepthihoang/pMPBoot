//  bionj2.cpp - Advertisment of NJ and BIONJ algorithms
//               (that work in terms of .mldist inputs and
//                NEWICK outputs); this class defines functions
//               that make those algorithms available, via a 
//               StartTree::Factory.

// Short names used for matrices and vectors (all indices start at 0).
//   D distance matrix (input, read from an .mldist file)
//   V estimated variance matrix (used in BIONJ, but not in NJ)
//   S bottom left triangle of the distance matrix,
//     with each row sorted in ascending order (see [SMP2011])
//   I index matrix, indicating (for each row of S, which cluster
//     each distance was calculated for).
//   Q connection-cost matrix (doesn't actually exist, cells of it
//     are calculated).
//   U vector of row totals (each row, the sum of the corresponding
//     row of the D matrix).  BIONJ implementations also use vectors
//     (indexed by cluster) of cluster totals.

// Notes:
// 1. Before 12-Aug-2020, the Matrix and ClusterTree template
//    classes were declared in this file (rather than in
//    separate headers) (see clustertree.h, distancematrix.h)
// 2. Before 31-Oct-2020,
//    (a) UPGMA_Matrix, VectorizedUPGMA_Matrix were here
//        (they are now in upgma.h)
//    (b) NJMatrix, UNJMatrix, BIONJMatrix, VectorizedMatrix,
//        VectorNJ, VectorBIONJ were here (now in nj.h)
//    (c) BoundingMatrix, RapidNJ, RapidBIONJ were here
//        (they are now in rapidnj.h).
